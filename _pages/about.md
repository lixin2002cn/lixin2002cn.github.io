I'm a tech enthusiast. I studied at Shandong University's School of Information Science and Engineering, advised by Professor [Chao Zhai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=wdj8YpwAAAAJ), and graduated in June 2024 as an outstanding student. I then pursued a PhD at the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, but took a leave in February 2025. I'm now at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), doing interdisciplinary research on large language models under Professor [Wei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wLtu3FYAAAAJ). 

My research interests are very broad, including but not limited to deep learning, electronic design and wireless communications.I am committed to applying deep learning technology to many aspects of society, and firmly believe that technology can bring better social equity, social development and social security.


My research now focuses on using large language models in traditional and interdisciplinary fields, especially second-generation models with reasoning skills. I believe these models can help traditional disciplines overcome current challenges and drive productivity breakthroughs. At Shandong University, I assessed psychological patterns and recognized behaviors of security personnel in special scenarios, emphasizing multi-modal data analysis and high-level semantic modeling in images. At the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I worked on extracting low-level visual features from hyperspectral remote-sensing images. I've also explored image segmentation, object detection, knowledge distillation, video recognition, video prediction, person re-identification,time series prediction, the Masked Image Modeling, and computational hyperspectral imaging.

I'm currently learning engineering and development skills and am passionate about AI applications. I'm also studying hardware, as I believe the integration of software and hardware is crucial. Deploying models to edge devices can make technology more accessible and truly improve lives.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on low level visual task, action recognition, video prediction,computational imaging, MultiModal data fusion,affective computing, LLM and so on.
