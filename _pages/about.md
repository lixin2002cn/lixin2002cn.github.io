I'm a tech enthusiast. I studied at Shandong University's School of Information Science and Engineering, advised by Professor [Chao Zhai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=wdj8YpwAAAAJ), and graduated in June 2024 as an outstanding student. I then pursued a PhD at the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, but took a leave in February 2025. I'm now at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), doing interdisciplinary research on large language models under Professor [Wei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wLtu3FYAAAAJ). 

My research interests are very broad, including but not limited to deep learning, electronic design and wireless communications.I am committed to applying deep learning technology to many aspects of society, and firmly believe that technology can bring better social equity, social development and social security.

My current research focuses on the combination of remote sensing information technology and deep learning, as well as the combination of social informatics and deep learning technology. Since 2022, I have been immersed in a variety of research and practical applications, encompassing Person Re-Identification (ReID), image super-resolution, video recognition, target detection, medical segmentationï¼Œmulti-modal sentiment analysis, electronic design, AIS anomaly detectionï¼Œmulti-frame super-resolution, time series prediction, and the Masked Image Modeling, broadening my expertise across a range of technological fields.I have recently been studying and practicing the application of large language models in professional fields.


Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on low level visual task, action recognition, video prediction,computational imaging, MultiModal data fusion,affective computing, LLM and so on.
