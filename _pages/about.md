My name is Li Xin. In September 2024, I graduated with honors as an Outstanding Graduate from the School of Information Science and Engineering at Shandong University, earning a bachelorâ€™s degree in Communication Engineering under the supervision of Professor [Chao Zhai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=wdj8YpwAAAAJ). From November 2023 to September 2024, I participated in the CAS Student Innovation Program at the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR), Chinese Academy of Sciences. Immediately afterward, I enrolled as a direct-entry Ph.D. student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on optical remote-sensing signal processing. In February 2025, I suspended my Ph.D. studies for personal reasons and joined the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as a research assistant, working on large language models under the guidance of Professor [Wei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wLtu3FYAAAAJ). In July 2025, I formally withdrew from UCAS and accepted a Ph.D. offer from HKUST(GZ)â€™s Data Science and Analytics Thrust for Fall 2025.


My research interests are quite broad, encompassing but not limited to deep learning, software development, and hardware design. My primary research focus is on large language models, particularly reasoning-driven LLM system-2. I am also conducting research in areas like Agent and VLM. Additionally, I am collaborating with friends on research in AI+communication and AI+remote sensing. The specific areas I have engaged with include hyperspectral computational imaging, ReID, multimodal emotion recognition, video prediction, action recognition, time series prediction, image super-resolution, image segmentation, image detection, knowledge distillation, and Masked Image Modeling. I am committed to applying deep learning technologies to various aspects of society, firmly believing that technology can bring about greater social equity, development, and security.

If youâ€™re interested in collaborating or exploring potential research opportunities, please concat me. (å¸¦å¸¦å¼Ÿå¼Ÿ).
