MMSA is a unified framework for multimodal emotion recognition developed by Tsinghua University.
It supports three datasets, MOSI, MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, and 15 multimodal emotion analysis models, 
as well as tasks such as emotion recognition and emotion intensity regression. 
This column will use MMSA v1.0 as an example to implement framework analysis and customized modules.
