Due to the high degree of encapsulation of Detectron2 and the obscure syntax, it often takes time to find the corresponding modules when carrying out the project. In addition, there is a lack of easy-to-understand introductory tutorials, and the official website tutorials lack flexibility. This series will start with topics such as Detectron2 installation, custom data sets, custom networks, and validation set loss printing to get started with Detectron2 step by step.
